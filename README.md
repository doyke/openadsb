openadsb
========

This is the OpenADSB project.  It is hardware, embedded firmware, and Mac/Linux/Windows 
application software for receiving and decoding ADS-B broadcasts and other Mode-S traffic 
sent by aircraft.

The hardware consists of a USB stick receiver.  The circuit was inspired by various other
hobby projects.  The firmware was adapted from adsb receivers posted online, as well
as the nonolith project for the Atmel XMega microcontrollers.

The app is written in Python and leverages various pieces of open-source code.  Credit
is given in the source files, where appropriate.
