Hardware
========

This USB stick receiver uses an Atmel XMEGA 16A4U and a simple 1090 MHz front end. 
The software dithers the detector threshold to achive a wider dynamic range.

Using this small antenna on the roof, I frequently get contacts over 200 miles away. 
In my location, 50 to 100 packets/second is common. In other locations, over 250 
packets/sec have been observed.
