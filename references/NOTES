Detecting preamble:
- find rising edge
- wait 500 nsec
- read low value
- wait 500 nsec
- read high value
- wait 500 nsec
- read low value
- wait 2000 nsec
- read high value
- wait 500 nsec
- read low value
- wait 500 nsec
- read high value
- wait 500 nsec
- read low value
- wait 2000 nsec


- Read twice per bit period.
- xor results.  if same, error
- else, if different, then first read is the bit value
- first bit is MSB, store in accumulator
- shift accumulator reg right one bit
- repeat 7 more times
- store byte into SRAM and incr pointer
- decrement byte count and if non-zero repeat bit decode loop

- else if zero, entire message is done
- time to validate.
- led on
- write data to serial port

- AVR ClkCPU is 32MHz max
- AVR can use internal '32mhz' osc running at 48 mhz directly for usbclk
- same osc can be 
- PLL can run up to 128MHz
- Run PLL at 96 MHz (48mhz input, 2 div), USB prescaler at 2, 
- half-bit period is 500 nsec (10 cycles at 20MHz, 12 cycles at 24MHz, 16 cycles at 32MHz)

- AC0 state is bit 4.  Other register bits can be forced to 0 

- IN: 1 cycle
- RJMP: 2 cycles
- CPI: 1 cycle, compare immediate sets Z flag.
- PUSH/POP: 2 cycles
- LSL, LSR, ROL, ROR: 1 cycle - shift and rotate
- Branches: 1 skipped, 2 taken
- SBRC, SBRS - 1-3 cycles, skip if register bit set/cleared (only for IO regs 0-31)
- SBIC, SBIS - 2-4 cycles, skip if IO bit set/cleared (only for IO regs 0-31)
- EOR: 1 cycle

- Mode A/C: pulses are 0.45 +/- 0.1 us wide
- Pulse period is 1.45 usec 
- F1/F2 framing pair is always 20.3 +/- 0.1 usec apart
- X pulse is always missing
- SPI pulse is optional
- total of 17 bit periods for Mode A/C

- Mode S: pulses are 0.50 us wide
- Bit period is 1.0 usec, with pulses in first or second half of bit
- Pulse in first half means 1, pulse in second half means 0
- Preamble is therefore 1, 1, blank, 0, 0, blank, blank, blank
- After preamble there are 56 or 112 bits

- decision tree:
	- find edge
	- look for short pulse
		- if not, check for DME/TACAS long pulse
			- check for next DME pulse
		- if so, check for another pulse at 1.0 us rate
			- yes, not Mode A/C, so continue checking for preamble
			- keep recording pulses until end of packet. Was it 56 or 112 bits?
		- no, check for 1.45 us rate?
			- yes, must be Mode A/C or Mode S 1 to 0 transition, check for another 1.45 uS separation
			- no

-- can loop ACA output back to a GPIO input, then can use SBIC/SBIS instructions
edge_det:
	sbis	PORTX,BITX	; is bit hi?	(3 if yes, 2 if no)
	rjmp	edge_det	; no, repeat	(2)
